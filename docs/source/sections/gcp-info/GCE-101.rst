Introduction to Google Compute Engine
*************************************

Google Compute Engine (GCE) is the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) component of Google
Cloud Platform (GCP).  `GCE <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/>`_ 
offers scale, performance and value, letting you easily create and run 
virtual machines (VMs) on Google infrastructure. 

We have tried to put together some basic documentation for ISB-CGC users who are new
to the Google Cloud Platform, but your main source of information should generally
be the official Google Cloud Platform `documentation <https://cloud.google.com/docs>`_.
We have found that sometimes the wealth of available information can result in 
information overload, so we hope that this brief introduction will be useful to you.
If you are still feeling lost, please let us know and we'll do our best to get you pointed
in the right direction.
