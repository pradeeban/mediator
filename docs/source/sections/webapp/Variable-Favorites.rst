Variable Favorites
*******************
A variable Favorites list is a way of creating custom groupings of the samples and/or participants that you are interested in analyzing further. For example, you can create a variable favorites list that span across multiple projects, only contain samples for which certain types of data are available, or focus on specific phenotypic characteristics.
