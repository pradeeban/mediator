**PURPOSE**

This feature allows you to create and manage Gene lists for use in subsequent analyses.  
From the Menu - Gene selection, you can Manage Gene Favorite, Create Gene Favorite(s) or Select Genes for a New Workbook analysis

**Creating A Gene Favorite**

To create a new Gene Favorite - 
  *  Begin by naming your new "Favorites list"; you can create many Favorites and use them later in workbooks.
  *  Next specify the Gene(s) to populate this list: you can upload a pre-existing list, or enter Genes one at a time by typing them into the input box (with auto-completion support). 

If duplicate symbols are entered they will be marked for your deletion or automatically dropped when the list is saved.  
If an unrecognized item is entered it will also be flagged for your attention.  
To aid in Gene selection, you can access the HGNC portal (Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee) via the 
`View Gene Identifiers <http://www.genenames.org/>`_ link provided under this Menu selection. 

**Terminology Used for Genes**
  * The `National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) <http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm>`_ created the Talking Glossary of Genetic Terms to help everyone understand the terms and concepts used in genetic research.  In addition to definitions, specialists in the field of genetics share their descriptions of terms, and many terms include images, animation and links to related terms.

**Resources**

A variety of on-line resources exist that may be useful for understanding and working with Gene identifiers, for example:
     * `Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGCN) <http://www.genenames.org>`_  or
     * `National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`_
