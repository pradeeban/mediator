***************************
Using Google Compute Engine
***************************

For those ISB-CGC users whose research goals require the ability
to run large compute jobs, all of the
power and infrastructure behind Google Compute 
(`Compute Engine <https://cloud.google.com/compute/>`_,
`Container Engine <https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/>`_,
`Dataproc <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/>`_, and
`Dataflow <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/>`_) and
`Google Genomics <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/>`_,
are at your disposal.

Our goal is to help you assemble the tools and 
data (TCGA data, your data, reference data, *etc*)  that you need to
answer your research questions in the most efficient and cost-effective
way possible.

Towards that end, we have created a github repository called 
`examples-Compute <https://github.com/isb-cgc/examples-Compute>`_ 
with examples to get you started.
This repository will continue to grow and we welcome your contributions and suggestions.
You can also find a number of useful 
`recipes <https://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/process_data.html>`_ 
in the 
`Google Genomics Cookbook <https://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_, 
also here on readthedocs.
