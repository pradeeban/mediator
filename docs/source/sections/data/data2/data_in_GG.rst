TCGA Data in Google Genomics
############################

In the future, BAM and VCF data will also be available in other forms in order to allow other modes of data
access (*eg* using the GA4GH API).  This will open up new, faster, more "cloud-aware" approaches to working with these data
(as illustrated by some of these Google Genomics `Cookbooks <https://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sections/analyze_data.html>`_).
