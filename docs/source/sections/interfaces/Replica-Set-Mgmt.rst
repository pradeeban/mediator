Replicaset management module manages the replica sets pointing to each of the data sources.

ReplicaSetHandlers are implemented for each of the data sources that are federated by MEDIator. The ReplicaSetHandlers
offer an internal implementation of the replica sets management.

ReplicaSetManagers are the core REST APIs of MEDIator. They leverage the ReplicaSetHandlers to manage the replica sets
of each of the data sources. There is a one-to-one mapping between the ReplicaSetManager api implementations and the
data sources.

TciaReplicaSetManager provides the REST API for managing the TCIA replica sets. Relevant documentation can be found in
the class as the method-level comments.
