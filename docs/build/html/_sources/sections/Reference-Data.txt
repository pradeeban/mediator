ISB-CGC Hosted Reference Data
#############################

In order to facilitate working with the TCGA data tables that the ISB-CGC is hosting in BigQuery, additional
reference data tables have also been created, others are hosted by Google Genomics, 
and suggestions for more are welcome at feedback@isb-cgc.org.

Platform Reference Data
=======================

Some reference data is necessary in order to work with data generated by specific platforms such as the
Illumina DNA Metylation array, or the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.  This section will
provide links to existing sources of information elsewere on the web, or will describe additional resources
that are hosted by the ISB-CGC.

DNA Methylation Platform Annotation
-----------------------------------
Most of the DNA Methylation data produced by the TCGA project was obtained using the Illumina 
Infinium HumanMethylation450 (aka 450k) BeadChip array.  Some of the earlier tumor types were assayed
on the older, 27k array.

Although additional details can be found at the Illumina_ webpage, we have uploaded the platform
annotation information into the BigQuery table isb-cgc:platform_reference.methylation_annotation

Each CpG locus is uniquely identified as described in this 
`technical note <http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/technotes/technote_cpg_loci_identification.pdf>`_
and this unique identifier can be used to look up and cross-reference data between the TCGA DNA methylation data table
and the platform annotation table.

Genome Reference Data
=====================

Reference data that describes or annotates the human (or other) genome(s) is described in this section.

miRTarBase
----------
The recently updated miRTarBase_ database (release 6.1) is also available as a BigQuery table: 
isb-cgc:genome_reference.miRTarBase

Google Genomics maintains a list of 
`publicly available datasets <http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/discover_public_data/index.html>`_, 
including **Reference Genomes**, 
the **Illumina Platinum Genomes**, information about the **Tute Genomics Annotation** table, *etc*.
