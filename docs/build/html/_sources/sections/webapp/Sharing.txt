Sharing a cohort
################

A cohort can only be shared by the owner of the cohort.

The person the cohort is shared with has read only access. If they would like to be able to edit the cohort, they would
first need to make a copy of it. This only copies the list of samples and participants associated to the cohort, and not
any additional information that may be private to the original owner of the cohort.

Sharing a visualization
#######################

A visualization can only be shared by the owner of the visualization.

The person the visualization is shared with has read only access. They may make changes to the plot settings, but they
will not be able to save those changes. If they want to be able to save changes, they need to clone the visualization
first. Underlying cohorts are shared with the user when the visualization is shared.making changes to those cohorts will
require the user to first clone the cohort as noted above.

Sharing a SeqPeek visualization
###############################

The person the SeqPeek visualization is shared with has read only access. They may make changes to the settings, but
