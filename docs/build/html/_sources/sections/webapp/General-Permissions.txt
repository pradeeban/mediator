General Permissions
*******************

Cohorts and visualizations have permissions that are distinct from the TCGA data access permissions.
Users may create cohorts and visualizations using the ISB-CGC web-app, and these cohorts and 
visualizations will, by default, be private to the user who created them.  Users may, however, 
also share these components of their interactive analyses.  There are two levels of permissions:

* **Owner**: As owner of a cohort or visualization, you are able to edit and share your cohort.
* **Reader**:  If a cohort or visualization is shared with you, you have view-only access:
    - You may be able to make configuration changes to plots in a visualizations, but you will not be able to save those changes;
    - You are able to comment on a cohort or plot, and your comments will be shared with all other Readers;
    - You may make a copy ("clone") of the cohort or visualization.  (You will be the owner of this copy.)
