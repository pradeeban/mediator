The ISB-CGC aims to serve the needs of a broad range of cancer researchers ranging from 
scientists or clinicians who prefer to use an interactive web-based application to access 
and explore the rich TCGA dataset, to computational scientists who want to write their own 
custom scripts using languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, and 
to algorithm developers who wish to spin up thousands of virtual machines to analyze hundreds 
of terabytes of sequence data.

This documentation is a work-in-progress, please let us know how we can improve 
it. feedback@isb-cgc.org
